### What I did

I started the thesis project by setting up the local LLM environment and creating the initial README.md file.

### What I learned

I learned how to use Ollama to run local LLMs. Also learned that the benchmarking will be a headache, if I'm going to use SWE-bench.

### What I want to do next

It's crucial to get the benchmarking right, so I need to research different benchmarking tools and methods for LLMs. Using MLFlow for tracking the experiments seems like a good idea.
